        <h2>On wiggly water molecules</h2>

        <p> During my last two years at Stanford, I was looking into some of the fascinating properties of water for my work in the <a href="http://markland.stanford.edu/">Markland group</a>.
        </p> 

        <h3>Water, jiggling balls, and excitations</h3>
        <p>
          Water is ubiquitous.
          It drives our global climate, it powers essential biological functions, it spawns civilizations, it feeds our species.
        And yet, it behaves particularly strangely, with its two hydrogens and single oxygen contributing to a wide variety of chemically useful properties.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most illuminating methods of understanding water's properties is via infrared (IR) spectroscopy.
          IR spectroscopy excites vibrational modes, or t2he stretches and twists and bends of a flexible molecule.
          In a sense, one might think of these vibrational excitations as a dance, where the two O-H bonds flex in concert, each linked with the movements of the other (i.e. vibrational coupling).
        </p>

        <p>
          Much work has been done on computational simulation of IR spectra, which would enable useful studies in aqueous enzyme environments, for example.
          It turns out that one can obtain the IR spectrum of a molecule by taking the Fourier-transform of its dipole autocorrelation function.
          Generally, these dipoles are obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which is where my work comes in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traditionally, one performs classical MD simulations, in which molecules are most commonly treated as balls connected by springs and thus subject to harmonic potentials.
          Many force fields exist which attempt to model the jiggling behavior of these molecules, to varying degrees of success.
          In principle, one can simply integrate Newton's equations of motion to propagate the system forward in time.
          However, these force field-based methods are limited by the specific parameters used, and ignore electronic effects often essential for describing chemical behavior.

          In an ideal world, we would be able to perfectly calculate the electronic structure (i.e. the wavefunction) of our many-body system of interest, thus understanding perfectly its chemical properties; however, computional tools obviously limit the tractability of this approach.
          Nevertheless, in the past few decades, advancements in hardware arising primarily from Moore's law and better approaches towards calculating electronic structure have rendered <i>ab initio</i> molecular dyanmics (AIMD) feasible (here, <i>ab initio</i> refers to a first-principles approach which relies on quantum mechanical calculations).
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps the most popular approach today employs density functional theory (DFT), which is given a lucid pedagogical introduction <a href="https://dasher.wustl.edu/chem430/readings/ijqc-113-96-13.pdf">here</a>.
          I won't go too much into the details, since they can be found in many places on the Internet, but the main thrust involves treating the ground-state energy of a molecule as a <i>functional of the electron density</i> (hence the name).
<!--           \begin{equation}
            E_0 = E[n(\textbf{r})]
          \end{equation} -->
          <!-- where $$n(\textbf{r})$$ is the electronic density. -->
          Here a functional simply refers to something which takes in a function and outputs a number (e.g. a definite integral).
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite its incredible utility and general performance on a wide range of chemical systems, DFT scales rather poorly with the system size, often making it a poor choice for larger molecules.
          This is where semi-empirical methods come in, and in my case, density functional tight-binding (DFTB) to be precise.
          Semi-empirical methods refer to a broad range of techniques which lie somewhat in between classical and quantum mechanical calculations.
          Generalizing slightly, they essentially maintain the wavefunction-based approach of quantum chemical calculations while reducing complexity by adding several empirically-determined parameters.

          For those who are not particularly familiar with biotech industry, Moderna is a (rather high-profile) company founded in 2010 by several Harvard faculty.
          Its focus is drugs based on RNA (DNA's less boring counterpart), rather than the conventional small-molecule approach.
          In particular, the biotech industry has long relied on the protein-target approach, in which one first identifies a faulty protein of interest (e.g. a checkpoint gone haywire in cancer cells) and then designs a molecular substance to block or activate that protein.
          However, this often doesn't work as expected, causing unwanted side effects or even horrible toxicity.
          Hence, the biotech industry has turned to other technologies, such as biologics, and, in Moderna's case, mRNA.
          Biologics are the kinds of proteins-turned-drugs that have basically included all the major breakthrough cancer therapies of the last few decades, including Herceptin (breast cancer), Rituxan (lymphoma) and Keytruda (melanoma).
      </p>
          <p>
          The other big thing that might turn out to revolutionize our current therapeutics are oligonucleotides, such as RNA.
          Because many diseases are caused by the nuclear material of their vector (most prominently viruses), RNA provides a unique strategy towards attacking new targets or even circumventing existing problems.
          Despite their great promise, it's still far too soon to determine whether this new strategy will pan out.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Morpholinos
        </h3>
        <p>
          Now, it turns out that long before people began thinking about using synthetic oligonucleotides for therapeutic purposes, researchers have employed them for probing biological systems.
          In develomental biology, scientists often want to ask questions along the lines of when and where to specific anatomies develop?
          More specifically, we often are trying to figure out how specific genes, molecules, and environmental cues interact with both <i>spatial</i> and <i>temporal</i> control to generate the body plans of animals we see around us.
          For example, how do we get left-right symmetry and asymmetry? 
          How does anterior-posterior organization arise?
          How do limbs develop?
          Since all these processes are controlled at heart by the action of genes and proteins, oligonucleotides present a powerful tool for probing them.
          In essence they allow us to selectively turn off (and on) genes at different points during development and at different locations in the body.
          With this knowledge, we can begin to untangle the complex biological networks that orchestrate the creation of a living organism from a single cell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morpholinos are a kind of oligonucleotide that chemical biologists have created to control such developmental processes.
          Recall from biology that each RNA nucleotide is composed of a sugar backbone (ribose), a nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil), and a phosphate group. 
          In morpholinos, however, there are two major changes with perturb the chemical stability: first, the ribose is converted to a morpholine ring, a six-membered oxygen and nitrogen heterocycle; and, second, one of the oxygens on the phosphate group is converted to a nitrogen, making a <i>phosphoramidate</i> group.
          The details are not so important, but the effect of these changes is that morpholinos are much more stable <i>in vivo</i> than RNA, which disintegrates rather quickly (and thus renders it difficult to use for biological experiments).
        </p>

        <p>
        	As a result, a synthetic morpholino, armed with the correct complementary gene sequence to a target mRNA, can hybridize (bind) to that mRNA <i>in vivo</i> and knockdown (i.e., shutoff) the gene of interest.
        	Although morpholinos are a formidable tool for investigating effects of specific genes, they suffer from precision both spatially and temporally.
        	When working with zebrafish, the typical protocol involves injecting the embryos at the single-cell (zygote) stage with the morpholino of choice, but this inevitably causes the morpholino to spread throughout the fish as it grows, preventing one from, say, turnoff a gene in only the fish's tail.
        	At the same time, it is challenging to control the time at which the morpholino acts.
        	After injection, the morpholino simply diffuses throughout the cells, encountering mRNAs and turning off genes in a stochastic fashion.
        </p>

        <p>
        	As I mentioned at the beginning of this section, these two aspects—spatial and temporal control—are essential to a detailed understanding of development; but the native approach of injecting morpholinos seems to preclude this.
        	A key development then was the idea of <i>caged</i> morpholinos (cMOs).
        	What if we could turn on and turn off the morpholino activity while it was already in the zebrafish, perhaps by activating it through an external cue?
        	The idea then is as follows: through a chemical modification of the morpholino, we attach the two ends together (caging) so that it is unable to bind to the target mRNA.
        	Then, we use light (which can be tuned very selectively) to break apart the chemical cage and allow the morpholino to hybridize.
