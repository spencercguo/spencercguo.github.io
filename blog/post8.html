  <h1>Denver</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>July 25, 2023.</h3>
  <hr>


  <p>
    I recently visited Denver for the first time and thought I'd write up some of the highlights
  of the food. My friend Molly was gracious enough to host and show me around the Mile High City.
  The first night, we and another friend visited a speakeasy called <i>Retrograde</i>, ensconced behind a freezer door
  in an ice-cream shop. There I had my first and perhaps most baffling brush with the law, wherein the bouncer glanced
  at my driver's license and immediately told me that they couldn't accept identification of vertical orientation. Even more
  strangely was the fact that he did allow me to use a picture of my passport on my phone, which begs the question of the relative ease of falsifying
  passport photos over geometric variations of driver's licenses.
  </p>
<p>
  Idenfication snafu notwithstanding, we were ushered over the threshold after a fifteen minute wait and into a dimly lit
  room with striking lighting and a projector on the wall. Just as striking were the fancifully named drinks ("The Amazing Bulk", "Vicious Lips")
  which combined several unrecognizable ingredients, such as "chareau" (aloe liqueur), "switched comoz blanc" (vermouth) with
  the baffling (acidified carrot). Nonetheless, they excelled in delivering alcohol and pleasure, ultimately the point of drinking at all.

  <b>
    Recommended: "Bikini Girls vs Dinosaurs"—a fresh, juicy highball with a nice minty-citrus backbone and an herbal undertone.
  </b>
</p>
   
<p>
  The next day began at the diner Sam's No. 3 (of which there are three locations, as expected, but all with the same number,
  unexpectedly). As all good diners, Sam's No. 3 boasts an expansive menu constructed from every possible combination
  of ten ingredients (programmatically generating a 1024 item-menu by combinatorics alone). I elected to try the "Rockies Burrito", 
  consisting of a flour tortilla filled with not just the usual breakfast burrito suspects of potatoes, eggs, and cheese, but
  also <emph>two full chiles rellenos</emph>, breaded, fried, and sauced in green chile; and then the whole thing covered in yet
  more cheese and a healthy helping of more green chile.
  
  (<i>N.B.</i> Green chile is not exactly the same thing as chile verde, but rather a distinctive local [?] dish that seems
  to permeate every food in Denver, and which I'll discuss in more detail later on.)

  Gratifyingly, our server proclaimed my choice "excellent," and his assessment was soon fulfilled as the largest burrito I've
  ever seen arrived. As I've written on this blog <a href="post7.html">before</a>, chiles rellenos provide a demonstration of the
  wonderful phenomenon I like to call "soggy fried" foods, where the crisp coating of the chile absorbs the moist green chile,
  providing new textural contrasts. In this case, the contrast was further augmented by the breakfast potatoes, eggs, and the
  flour tortilla, yielding an bacchanale of textures. My only complaint is that the chiles rellenos were, peculiarly, stuffed
  with yellow cheese instead of the typical white queso Oaxaca or Chihuahua. 
</p> 

<p>
  That night, we prepared a simple dinner of panzanella and roasted vegetables. There's not too much to say here,
  but I'll note again that panzanella is another beautiful illustration of the "soggy fried" concept, though
  more precisely the bread is just baked to dehydrate it rather than fried. The key to a good panzanella is good tomatoes,
  just like many great pleasures in life (BLTs, tomato sandwiches, caprese salad
  <input type="checkbox" id="cb1" /><label for="cb1"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
    A useful maxim is to never make a caprese salad with off season
    tomatoes! Lest you be forever disappointed in your life choices.<br><br></span>).
  In an ideal panzanella, dehydrated bread is reanimated by the rich liquid extracted from ripe tomatoes, imbuing
  every bite with both concentrated tomato flavor and residual crunch from the bread. The tomatoes themselves add 
  further textural contrast.
</p>


<h3>Green chile: an ode and interlude</h3>
<p>

</p>

<p>
  Upon recommendation of Molly parents, I sought out the breakfast burrito at a local café Honey Hill.
  By now, you should be able to guess that it includes green chile (along with the requisite potatoes
  and eggs). Lots of breakfast burritos in Denver! Unlike the first one, however, this burrito was manageably
  sized and texturally homogenous for the most part. Although I've extolled the virtues of texture contrasts
  the beauty of textural homogeneity, especially when it comes to soft foods, can be just as luxurious.
  In this case, the eggs and potatoes provided subtle shades of tenderness, with just
  the right amount of toothsomeness coming from the tortilla. The green chile lent its welcome acidic undertone,
  much like a good hot sauce does. Overall, a burrito that reached its high expectations.
</p>

<p>
  For lunch, we returned to in fact the same location, just across the street, where the reputed Spinelli's
  grocery serves a lineup of classic sandwiches. 
</p>

<h3>Tacos to remember</h3>
<p>
  On my final day, we decided one would be remiss in a food tour of Denver without sampling the tacos.
  The ever-reliable food publication <emph>Eater</emph> had recently <a href="https://denver.eater.com/maps/best-tacos-denver">published</a>
  a guide to the best in the city, so that guided our choices.

  Before the first stop, we stopped by at Huckleberry Coffee Roasters (multiple locations), which was listed
  on a collaborative coffee map
  <input type="checkbox" id="cb2" /><label for="cb2"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
    Shameless plug: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CKQcDkD9faApMTjt5">the map</a> has recommended coffee shops, roasteries
    etc. throughout the US.<br><br></span>
  that some friends and I maintain.
