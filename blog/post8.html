  <h1>Denver</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>October 22, 2023.</h3>
  <hr>


  <p>
    I recently visited Denver for the first time and thought I'd write up some of the highlights
  of the food. My friend Molly was gracious enough to host and show me around the Mile High City.
  The first night, we and another friend visited a speakeasy called <i>Retrograde</i>, ensconced behind a freezer door
  in an ice-cream shop. There I had my first and perhaps most baffling brush with the law, wherein the bouncer glanced
  at my driver's license and immediately told me that they couldn't accept identification of vertical orientation. Even more
  strangely was the fact that he did allow me to use a picture of my passport on my phone, which begs the question of the relative ease of falsifying
  passport photos over geometric variations of driver's licenses.
  </p>
<p>
  Idenfication snafu notwithstanding, we were ushered over the threshold after a fifteen minute wait and into a dimly lit
  room with striking lighting and a projector on the wall. Just as striking were the fancifully named drinks ("The Amazing Bulk", "Vicious Lips")
  which combined several unrecognizable ingredients, such as "chareau" (aloe liqueur), "switched comoz blanc" (vermouth) with
  the baffling (acidified carrot). Nonetheless, they excelled in delivering alcohol and pleasure, ultimately the point of drinking at all.

  <emph>Recommended:</emph> "Bikini Girls vs Dinosaurs"—a fresh, juicy highball with a nice minty-citrus backbone and an herbal undertone.
  
</p>
   
<p>
  The next day began at the diner Sam's No. 3 (of which there are three locations, as expected, but all with the same number,
  unexpectedly). As all good diners, Sam's No. 3 boasts an expansive menu constructed from every possible combination
  of ten ingredients (programmatically generating a 1024 item-menu by combinatorics alone). I elected to try the "Rockies Burrito", 
  consisting of a flour tortilla filled with not just the usual breakfast burrito suspects of potatoes, eggs, and cheese, but
  also <emph>two full chiles rellenos</emph>, breaded, fried, and sauced in green chile; and then the whole thing covered in yet
  more cheese and a healthy helping of more green chile.
  
  (<i>N.B.</i> Green chile is not exactly the same thing as chile verde, but rather a distinctive local [?] dish that seems
  to permeate every food in Denver, and which I'll discuss in more detail later on.)

  Gratifyingly, our server proclaimed my choice "excellent," and his assessment was soon fulfilled as the largest burrito I'd
  ever seen arrived. As I've written on this blog <a href="post7.html">before</a>, chiles rellenos provide a demonstration of the
  wonderful phenomenon I like to call "soggy fried" foods, where the crisp coating of the chile absorbs the moist green chile,
  providing new textural contrasts. In this case, the contrast was further augmented by the breakfast potatoes, eggs, and the
  flour tortilla, yielding an bacchanale of textures. My only complaint is that the chiles rellenos were, peculiarly, stuffed
  with yellow cheese instead of the typical white queso Oaxaca or Chihuahua. 
</p> 

<p>
  That night, we prepared a simple dinner of panzanella and roasted vegetables. There's not too much to say here,
  but I'll note again that panzanella is another beautiful illustration of the "soggy fried" concept, though
  more precisely the bread is just baked to dehydrate it rather than fried. The key to a good panzanella is good tomatoes,
  just like many great pleasures in life (BLTs, tomato sandwiches, caprese salad
  <input type="checkbox" id="cb1" /><label for="cb1"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
    A useful maxim is to never make a caprese salad with off season
    tomatoes! Lest you be forever disappointed in your life choices.<br><br></span>).
  In an ideal panzanella, dehydrated bread is reanimated by the rich liquid extracted from ripe tomatoes, imbuing
  every bite with both concentrated tomato flavor and residual crunch from the bread. The tomatoes themselves add 
  further textural contrast.
</p>


<h3>Green chile: an ode and interlude</h3>
<p>
  As I've been alluding to already, one of Denver's great pleasures is green chile, more in the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_chile">New Mexican</a> style, though perhaps
  less well-known. Like New Mexico's famed green chiles (I'm referring here to the vegetable rather than the stew
  <input type="checkbox" id="cb2" /><label for="cb2"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
    Yes, I know that botanically chiles are 
    fruits. The US Supreme Court would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_v._Hedden">agree</a> with me when it comes to common usage, though.<br><br></span>),
    Colorado's local chiles (apparently called <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1222825/pueblo-the-chile-variety-that-grows-exclusively-in-colorado/">Pueblo</a> chiles)
    are a mainstay in the local chile stew. My wonderful hosts, Molly's parents, graciously offered to give a taste 
    of their world-famous green chile. I'll have to check on the specifics of the recipe once I get them from Molly's dad,
    but the main components seem to be (besides the eponymous ingredient) simply tomatoes and garlic for flavor. One can add pork,
    but it's not at all necessary. Interestingly, compared with pozole verde—what I assume must be green chile's ancestor—it uses
    plain red tomatoes rather than the green tomatillo (same nightshade family, but different genuses). However, the rich, complex
    flavors of the green chiles are plenty to provide a great depth to the stew and the tomatoes provide an unexpectedly pleasant acidity. Although you can certainly
    see the family resemblance to pozole, the details have on been changed. But they make for a distinctive eating experience, due to the lower
    acidity of the red tomatoes with regard to tomatillos and the different flavors of typical green chiles.
    Served with some hominy, fresh cilantro, avocado, and lime, I have to admit that green chile absolutely <emph>slaps</emph>.
    A great hit from the great city of Denver.
</p>

<p>
  The next day, upon recommendation of Molly parents, I sought out the breakfast burrito at a local café Honey Hill.
  By now, you should be able to guess that it includes green chile (along with the requisite potatoes
  and eggs). Lots of breakfast burritos in Denver! Unlike the first one, however, this burrito was manageably
  sized and texturally homogenous for the most part. Although I've extolled the virtues of texture contrasts,
  textural homogeneity, especially when it comes to soft foods, can be just as luxurious (think tortilla española).
  In this case, the eggs and potatoes provided subtle shades of tenderness, with just
  the right amount of toothsomeness coming from the tortilla. The green chile lent its welcome acidic undertone,
  much like a good hot sauce does. Overall, a burrito that met its high expectations.
</p>

<p>
  For lunch, we returned to in fact the same corner, just across the street, where the reputed Spinelli's
  grocery serves a lineup of classic sandwiches. Although their typical sandwiches tend
  to encompass the more traditional deli makeup of cold cuts and cheeses, I decided on a special of the day with cochinita pibil, 
  slaw, and habanero sauce. The sandwich was served on some kind of roll with a soft, slightly chewy texture that absorbed the 
  juices from the pork admirably. The slaw provided a welcome tangy note and crunchy contrast, but I found the habanero sauce
  to be rather lacking in fire, given that it was supposed to be made with habaneros. Yucatec food, to my knowledge, is especially
  spicy given their liberal application of habanero chiles, so I was expecting more of a punch; although, certainly Spinelli's is 
  not known for their Mexican cuisine.
</p>

<h3>Tacos to remember</h3>
<p>
  On my final day, we decided one would be remiss in a food tour of Denver without sampling the tacos.
  The ever-reliable food publication <emph>Eater</emph> had recently <a href="https://denver.eater.com/maps/best-tacos-denver">published</a>
  a guide to the best in the city, so that narrowed down our choices.

  Before the first stop, we visited Huckleberry Coffee Roasters (multiple locations), which was listed
  on a collaborative coffee map
  <input type="checkbox" id="cb3" /><label for="cb3"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
    Shameless plug: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CKQcDkD9faApMTjt5">the map</a> has recommended coffee shops, roasteries
    etc. throughout the US and abroad.<br><br></span>
  that some friends and I maintain. The shop we visited is located on the western side of Denver in a neighborhood called Sunnyside.
  On a side note unrelated to coffee, we passed several so called <a href="https://denverite.com/2017/11/29/replace-dreaded-denver-slot-home/">slot homes</a>
  in the area, which have apparently generated quite a bit of hullabaloo<input type="checkbox" id="cb4" /><label for="cb4"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>Who knew that it was spelled thus? I certainly did not.<br><br></span>
   (see the linked article) regarding their rather
  blatant disregard for neighborhood atmosphere (and aesthetics, in my opinion). Having all the doors to peoples homes facing inwards
  seems like an awful way to stimulate the natural interaction that characterizes a healthy community, so I was pleased to hear
  that the city was trying to place a moratorium on construction of new slot homes.
  Digression on urban planning aside, the coffee at Huckleberry was incredible, and the barista super helpful
  in picking out some bags of coffee beans to bring home. These days, when I visit a new coffee shop, I more often
  than not order a plain drip coffee as a useful barometer the shop as a whole
  (one might also try their plain espresso, but I don't enjoy that as much). The reasoning goes that making really good drip
  coffee requires diligence—good beans and equipment, obviously, but, most importantly, care in making sure the drip coffee
  remains relatively fresh (not letting it turn stale) and as good as the lattes. Moreover, drip coffee is <emph>transparent</emph>:
  you can't hide slightly off beans with the flavor of milk (or syrup). It's easy to put a lot of care into good espresso drinks
  while forgetting about your run-of-the-mill drip coffee because it's less pretty and most people won't notice.
  The one at Huckleberry, I am pleased to report, was fantastically complex, fruity, and acidic, with none of the strange off flavors you sometimes
  find out of a rarely washed coffee machine. I would definitely put it near the top of my list of the best coffee
  I've had this year.
</p>

<p>
  After coffee, we took a not-short detour to visit the Red Rock Amphiteatre, a notable local attraction featuring a naturally occurring rock amphitheatre 
  purposed for musical events. As a brief note, I find it incredbly fascinating how the geological topology produces such a remarkable acoustic in the outdoor
  venue, and that such a formation just exists in the mountains for us humans to avail ourselves with. The walk up and around the amphitheatre helpfully
  built up an appetite before our first taco stop at Garibaldi Mexican Bistro (in the southern part of Denver near Englewood). Most charming about Garibaldi
  Mexican Bistro is that it's located <emph>inside a gas station</emph> (a Conoco, if you care), which truly raises the bar for "hole-in-the-wall" spots, though
  entering the restaurant admits a perfectly clean and normal-looking ambiance. One of the walls is decorated with Meixcan heros of folk and pop fame, which 
  I greatly enjoyed and Molly helpfully identified. Their specialties include Aztec-inspired dishes such as the tacos aztecas with blue corn tortillas and nopales
  that I ordered (picture below). I was shocked when the tacos arrived piled so high with assorted toppings of tomato, lettuces, cheese, nopales, that
  one could almost not see the underlying meat nor tortilla. The tacos aztecas came with chorizo and cecina, which I had never tried before. Cecina is a rather curious
  preparation that involves salted and air-dried meat (almost like jerky)
    Like jerky, cecina was also invented as a method to preserve meat in the arid, hot climates of northern Mexico.
    The production process is quite <a href="https://mexkitchen.blogspot.com/2009/06/cecina-worth-its-salt.html">involved</a> and challenging, requiring both
    exceptional skill with a knife to unroll a large cut of meat and adequate climatic conditions to dry it out.
    <input type="checkbox" id="cb5" /><label for="cb5"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
      Here are <a href="https://www.gob.mx/agricultura/morelos/articulos/la-cecina-uno-de-los-platillos-mas-representativo-del-estado-de-morelos?idiom=es#:~:text=La%20cecina%20tuvo%20su%20inicio,exploraci%C3%B3n%20y%20conquista%20de%20Am%C3%A9rica">more</a>
      <a href="https://www.saborearte.com.mx/el-verdadero-origen-de-la-cecina/">links</a> (courtesy of Molly) in Spanish with information
      on the history and production of cecina.<br><br></span>
  The first bite of the taco exploded with flavors of each of the components: smoke and umami from the cecina, acidity from the nopal, freshness from 
  the vegetables, saltiness from the cheese, piquancy from the salsa, and a bass-like earthiness from the blue corn tortilla.
  The experience felt kaleidoscopic and yet each part felt integral to the whole, as any good taco should be.
  To be honest, I am not generally a fan of nopales due to their sour taste and rather mucilaginous texture, but here 
  they provided a wonderful bright contrast to the richness of the meat. Altogether, a 10/10 taco-eating experience for me.
  Our second and unfortunately final stop, because the Aztec tacos were so filling, was at Tacos Tequila Whiskey, with a completely
  different ambiance—clearly catering to the yuppie crowd with "an elevated take on street tacos" (Google's words, not mine). 
  We ordered one pork belly taco with a crema-based sauce and a grilled mushroom taco with chipotle corn (I also tried their paloma, which
  was delicious). The pork belly was succulent and deeply spiced, almost reminiscent of five-spice pork, while the grilled mushrooms taco was
  rich and layered with the corn and creamy sauce. Were they both delicious? Absolutely. Would I eat them again? Absolutely. Would I still
  rather have a banging al pastor taco from a food truck at half the price? Absolutely. Alas, such is the existence of an 
  upscale taco restaurant. 
  </p>
<p>
  So with that, it was time to leave Denver for the time being, but not without a hearty and satisfying introduction
  to the city's myriad food options. Thanks again to Molly for being such a wonderful host and Denver expert, and I certainly 
  hope to be back soon to continue these delicious adventures.
