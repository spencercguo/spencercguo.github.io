    <h1>Bonjour</h1>
    <h2>A brief review and a throwback </h2>

    <p>
        I decided to talk a walk around my neighborhood today to enjoy the snow.
        On the way back to my apartment, I decided to stop by at a place called Café Bonjour (hence the title of today's
        post) which I had seen before in previous explorations of Hyde Park but had never tried.
        Although it was closed for indoor dining, I found the inside to be quite charming and reminiscent of the
        patisseries in Paris.
        There was a modest selection of pastries, including the classic croissants and éclairs, though what caught my
        eye was the "morning bun."
        It appeeared rather like a <a
            href="https://www.eater.com/2016/4/13/11410646/kouign-amann-pastry-france-america">kouign-amann</a>
        (pronounced <i>kween-amahn</i>) with its sugar-coated crust.
        The article I linked discusses at length how the Dominique Ansel bakery in New York (famous primarily for their
        Cronut™) popularized this rather unknown pastry early in the 2010s (as a sidetnote, it's crazy to think that we
        are already a decade removed!).
        Rather fascinatingly, the word kouign-amann comes from the Breton language which is part of the Celtic rather
        than the Romance family (hence the unexpected pronunciation).
        Getting back to the original point, I actually first tasted a kouign-amann at Dominique Ansel's bakery in SoHo.
        I was distinctly impressed by the juxtaposition between the buttery lamination (similar to that of a croissant)
        and the crisp exterior of caramelized sugar.
        The outside reminds me of the toasty sugar in a toffee or a hard caramel.
        If you get the opportunity, I highly recommend trying one for the unique experience.

        After paying for the morning bun, I went outside to enjoy it.
        Despite the sub-optimal pastry-eating conditions, I was rather impressed.
        It had the same crunchy crust of sugar as I remember vividly from my previous experience, accompanied by a
        relatively dense, moist interior scented with cinnamon sugar and butter.
        To be fair, I have to note several confounding factors in my assessment--first, the fact that I hadn't had a
        pastry of this kind in a long time, so my judgment might be skewed; and, second, I was sitting outside in the
        January weather, which in addition to affecting my physical senses also caused the bun to cool very quickly (it
        was still vaguely warm when I bought it).
        Although today's pastry wasn't explicitly labeled as a kouign-amann, it distinctly resembled it both in
        appearance and taste.
        From the <i>Eater</i> article, I guess strictly speaking a true kouign-amann is notably made with salted butter
        (a specialty of Brittany, from where it originates), whereas the morning bun I had was certainly not.
        Overall, I was quite satisfied with my discovery today, and I'm looking forward to visiting the café again to
        try more of their pastries.
        Thanks again for reading!
    </p>
