            <p> Hello and welcome to my personal website!
                My name is Spencer Guo and I am a Ph.D. candidate in chemistry at the <a href="https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>, where I am jointly advised by <a href="http://dinner-group.uchicago.edu/">Aaron Dinner</a> and <a href="http://thallium.bsd.uchicago.edu/RouxLab/index.html">Benoît Roux</a>.
                I graduated from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> where I did my degree in chemistry.
                At the moment, I'm grateful to be supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> and the <a href="https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/academics/financial-aid/eckhardt-scholars/">Eckhardt Graduate Scholarship</a>.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            My academic work lies broadly in theoretical and computational biophysics, primarily focused on understanding proteins from a dynamical and mechanistic perspective.
            In layman's terms, I use computers to watch how molecules in your body (<emph>proteins</emph>) jiggle around (<emph>dynamics</emph>) and try to learn interesting things (<emph>mechanisms</emph>) from the seemingly random movement. 
            
            You can read more about this <a href="#science">below</a> or in my <a href="research.html">blog</a> (where I also discuss general scientific topics I find interesting).
        <p>
            While at Stanford, I was in the <a href="http://markland.stanford.edu/">Markland group</a> investigating various methods of simulating infrared spectra for condensed-phase systems (mostly <a href="./research/water.html">water</a>).
            <!-- You can read more about that project <a href="research.html">here</a>! -->
            Before that, I worked in the <a href="http://chen.stanford.edu">Chen lab</a> synthesizing optochemical probes for studying <a href="./research/fish.html">zebrafish</a> development and at Genentech. <!-- performing solid-phase peptide synthesis. -->
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides science, I enjoy playing violin and piano.
            At Stanford, I was in the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/scor/">Stanford Collaborative Orchestra (SCOr)</a> and the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/sso/cgi-bin/orchestras/">Stanford Symphony Orchestra</a>.

            Food
        </h3>
        <p>
            I love all things food and cooking, whether it be American staples such as mashed potatoes, a classic French bœuf bourguignon, or Shanghainese specialities ranging from <a href="https://shanghaiist.com/2013/11/28/off_the_beaten_palate_drunken_hairy/">drunken hairy crab</a> to <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shengjian_mantou">shengjianbao</a>.
            I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab">The Food Lab</a>, headed by the inimitable J. Kenji López-Alt, which I credit to giving me a knowledge of the scientific principles which underlie cooking.

            While studying abroad in Paris during the winter of 2018, I maintained a <a href="https://labouffepourlapensee.wordpress.com/">blog</a> in an effort to document my food experiences.

        <p>
        I've revived my <a href="blog/index.html">food blog</a> in a new form on this website! There I discuss anything which I find interesting and is tangentially related to food.

            As a mentioned above, my research work tries to answer the general problem of understanding protein dynamics in all its forms, especially to elucidate mechanisms and compute kinetics.
            Of course, the real question is why do we care about protein dynamics and mechanisms at all?
            Broadly speaking, traditional methods of looking at proteins (such as x-ray crystallography) can only yield static snapshots.
            Yet we can't fully understand their activity from these snapshots, just as we can't ascertain the plot of a movie from stills alone.
            To answer questions about enzymes—proteins which speed up essential reactions in your body such as metabolism—we need to understand how the target molecule binds or unbinds to the protein and how its complex machinery activates to catalyze the reaction of interest, all of which is necessarily a dynamic process. 
            On a more practical note, we hope that a deeper understanding of protein dynamics and mechanisms will allow us to more precisely design therapeutics that do what we want.
            For example, to design fast- or slow-acting therapeutic formulations of insulin, we need to know how insulin activates from its injected formulation on short and long time-scales.
            <!-- These insulin analogues take advantage of specific molecular changes (which we can model and rationalize) to either speed up or slow down the -->

            In this vein, I recently have been interested in the following areas:

                Mechanism of voltage-activation in a voltage-sensitive phosphatase.
                (<emph>The process which underlies action potentials in your nerves.</emph>)

              <li>
                  <a href="research/insulin.html">Dynamics of insulin dimer dissociation.</a>
                  (<emph>How do we solve diabetes?</emph>)
                <!-- Read more about that work <a href="research/insulin.html">here</a>! -->
              </li>
              <li>
                Computational methods based in operator theory to extract kinetic and mechanistic quantities for chemical reactions from simulation data.
                (<emph>How to get the most interesting things out of your [super]computer most efficiently.</emph>)
